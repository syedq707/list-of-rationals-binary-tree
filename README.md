# list-of-rationals-binary-tree
Here's a way to construct a list containing every positive rational number:  Build a binary tree where each node is a rational and the root is 1/1, with the following rules for creating the nodes below:  The value of the left-hand node below a/b is a/a+b The value of the right-hand node below a/b is a+b/b So the tree will look like this:                         1/1                   /           \              1/2                  2/1            /    \              /     \        1/3        3/2        2/3       3/1       /   \      /   \      /   \     /   \    1/4    4/3  3/5   5/2  2/5   5/3  3/4   4/1   ...
